Welcome to my Baccarat Program! This is an enhanced and upgraded version of a Project I did in my Software Design course. It includes a visually appealing UI and a turn-by-turn interactive element when facing the computer. This game was developed in Java using JavaFX. The game follows traditional Baccarat rules.

## How to Play
Here is a simple [guide](https://fallsviewcasinoresort.com/content/dam/fallsview/PDF/Playing/FCR-BaccaratGuide.pdf) on how to play Baccarat

## Example Execution
Here I am betting $100 that Player would win (I lost)

Here I am betting $150 that Banker would win (I lost again...)
![1DF00570-FE06-447A-BB1D-4769A9BCF7A9_1_201_a](https://github.com/uic-maratos/homework-0-igarcia11235/assets/118215639/3f1da32f-e4ff-4561-9025-e32ab040a181)

Finally, I decided there would be a draw (I won Woohoo!)
